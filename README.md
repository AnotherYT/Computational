# Computational
Welcome to the repository of Computational for Physics.
This will hold all different files in the python programming language. These can be used to either learn how to use python libraries or on how some physics models work, the reader and user is taken for granted that they already know how to simple program in python or in general (so for loops, if and else statements).
All PDE will be written using hiragana and katakana as perice when derivating with respect to a variable: あ (first variable) to ツ (twelfth variable).
